# ✈️🚗🐾 Animal & Object Image Classifier (Python + Keras)

This deep learning project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with Python and Keras to classify images into 8 categories. It demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in handling diverse datasets containing both animals and objects.

## 🧩 Categories

The model classifies images into the following 8 categories:

- ✈️ Airplane  
- 🚗 Car  
- 🐦 Bird  
- 🐱 Cat  
- 🦌 Deer  
- 🐶 Dog  
- 🐸 Frog  
- 🐴 Horse  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11
- **Keras** (with TensorFlow backend)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**
